Spenser's data science portfolio.

# [Project 1: Google Data Analytics Case Study](https://github.com/spensersmith99/Google-Data-Analytics-Case-Study)
* Analyzed data from a bike sharing company to determine effective ways to convert customers into monthly subscribers
* Cleaned over 300,000 items in Excel using tools like conditional formatting, COUNTIF/COUNTBLANK functions, and sorting/filtering
* Created pivot tables that helped draw conclusions such as casuals tend to spend more time on the bike per ride, and males account for an overwhelming majority of monthly subscribers
* Made accompanying data visualizations that helped highlight these findings

# [Project 2: MATLAB library of my completed work](https://github.com/spensersmith99/MATLAB-library)
* Solved a variety of complex problems by creating the necessary algorithms
* Showcases extensive knowledge of functions, numerical analysis, array/matrix manipulation(necessary for data storage), and plots
