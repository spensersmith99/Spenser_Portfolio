# Project 1: Google Data Analytics Case Study
* Analyzed data from a bike sharing company to determine effective ways to convert customers into monthly subscribers
* Cleaned over 300,000 items in Excel using tools like conditional formatting, COUNTIF/COUNTBLANK functions, and sorting/filtering
* Created pivot tables that helped draw conclusions such as casuals tend to spend more time on the bike per ride, and males account for an overwhelming majority of monthly subscribers
* Made accompanying data visualizations that help highlight these findings
